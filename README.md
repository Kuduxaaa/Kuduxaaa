### About Me 🧑

Hi there 👋 Welcome to my Github profile, my name is Nika Kudukhashvili (Kuduxaaa). I am a **Cyber Security Specialist**, **Software Engineer**, **Fullstack Web Developer**, **Python developer** and **Android developer** from Georgia 🇬🇪 I have three years of experience in this field and I can confidently say that during these three years I have gained a lot of experience in penetration testing & ethical hacking also development. I have been working on personal projects lately, as a result of which I have gained a lot of experience and developed professional skills. You can see a small part of my codes on Github as well, I mostly do not have free time 😄 but when I have I like to draw, watch movies and eat 🤣🤣 that is exactly why I have chosen __C0D1N6 4ND 347 ❤️__ to motto. **I am currently unemployed and looking for a job**!
